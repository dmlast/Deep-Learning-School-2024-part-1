# Deep-Learning-School-2024-part-1
In this repository I keep my homework, which I do as part of the first part of the MIPT Deep Learning School project.

* **Homework 1** was provided to feature engineering and consisted of solving classification problems about which of the Game of Thrones characters would survive. Various methods of feature engineering were implemented, but classifiers were developed: `Logistic Regression`, `AdaBoostClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `Gaussian Process Classifier`, `GaussianNB`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `SVC`. A gridsearch was conducted. After that, the boosting of the classifier (`gradient`, `xgm`, `lgbm`, `catboost`) was developed. Then, unimportant features were noted to combat retraining. In this assignment, **I was able to get a quality metric for the maximum score (accuracy = 0.85)**.
* **Homework 2** was devoted to the independent manual implementation of linear models. Classes of gradient descent, logistic regression, and logistic regression with regularization were written and implemented. The models were then used to classify the images (zeros and ones)
